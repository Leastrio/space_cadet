# SpaceCadet
[![discord badge][]][discord link]

SpaceCadet is an upcoming discord wrapper for elixir. It is extremely WIP, so I do not recommend running on any production bots. Contributions are gladly accepted.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `space_cadet` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:space_cadet, github: "Leastrio/space_cadet"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/space_cadet>.
